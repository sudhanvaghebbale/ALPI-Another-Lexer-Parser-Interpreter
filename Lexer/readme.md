#### To generate tokens, save code in script.txt and run lexer.py the stream of tokens should be generated in tokens.txt


### TODO:
- [x] Lexer should be able to handle syntax errors.
- [x] Remove comments from input source.
- [x] Accomodated String declarations in source.
- [x] Output file readable by prolog Script.
- [ ] To make the lexer.py take filenames as arguments from shell to compile tokens on-the-go. 
- [ ] Execute Multiple files at once?
- [ ] Tokenizer doesn't tokenize ,.+-^|/\= so, need spaces between characters when declaring them.
