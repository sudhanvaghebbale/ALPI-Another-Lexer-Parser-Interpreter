Plan for the coming weeks:
    - Week 1:
        - Evaluation rules for the grammar in Assignment 3 and extras (Sudhanva)
        - Building a lexer using Python NLTK (Ankit)
        - Start building parser for new rules in Prolog (Harmish and Jubanjan)
    
    - Week 2:
        - Build evaluation rules for the generated parse tree (Sudhanva, Harmish, Jubanjan)
        - Integrate Lexer and Parser (Ankit)
        - Test evaluation rule for a variety of test cases (All)
