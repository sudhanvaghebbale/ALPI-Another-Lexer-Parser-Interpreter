This repository contains code, sample programs and the entire documentation regarding the implementation details of our new programming language, **ALPI - Another Lexer Parser Interpreter**.

## Tools used to build ALPI
* OS: MacOS and Windows
* Lexer: PLY(Python Lexer and YACC)
* Parser: PLY(Python Lexer and YACC)
* Runtime: Python3

### What is PLY?
[PLY](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html) is a pure-Python implementation of the popular compiler construction tools **lex** and **yacc**. It basically allows the use of Python3 to evaluate parse trees, which are generated using the LALR(1) parsing mechanism.
